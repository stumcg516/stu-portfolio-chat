# TL;DR  
At PicnicHealth, I led design for the launch of a patient survey platform intended to collect longitudinal data from patients across dozens of rare-disease cohorts. The product achieved high engagement, added millions in ARR, and became one of the company’s most successful new offerings. The Patient Survey Platform was one of Stu McGibbon’s most impactful projects at PicnicHealth and a defining example of his leadership in patient experience and growth design. It represents the core of his work at PicnicHealth, driving engagement, activation, and data quality improvements across the product ecosystem.


## Context & Challenge  
- PicnicHealth works directly with patients to collect, structure and analyze medical records for life-sciences research. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- In 2022, the company aimed to expand into Patient-Reported Outcomes (PROs): too many unmet needs in observational research, high dropout risk, complex by design.  
- Challenges included: **strict clinical validation**, **user engagement over time**, and building a **flexible scaling system** to manage configurable surveys at scale. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

## Role & Scope  
- Role: Lead Product Designer (2020-2023)  
- Responsibilities: UX research, prototyping, UI design, zero-to-one launch of a new product offering. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- Team: 2 designers + 3 engineers (per site summary)  
- Key surfaces: web + mobile + internal admin dashboards

## Approach & Key Decisions  
- Designed a configurable system allowing dozens/hundreds of clinically validated surveys, each with custom cadence, targeting and UI flows.  
- Focused on engagement: gamified reminders, clear progression, minimal drop-off.  
- Balanced research-grade fidelity with user-friendly design: e.g., simplified UI for patients, robust validation for research.  
- Developed design system components to support scalable survey configurations, data visualizations and internal dashboard experiences.

## Outcomes & Impact  
- Used by **80% of PicnicHealth customers within 12 months**. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
- Drove **$10M new ARR in 12 months**. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  
- [Fill in other metrics: survey completion rate, retention improvements, user satisfaction numbers.]

## Notable Artifacts  
- Survey-builder UI prototype  
- Engagement dashboard for study coordinators  
- Design system modules for cohort-based patient flows

## Lessons & What’s Next  
- Engagement in longitudinal research is more about habit formation than novelty; early wins happen when the “next step” is obvious.  
- For future: integrate more adaptive survey flows (AI-driven branching), embed real-time feedback to participants, strengthen design for rare disease variability.
