# TL;DR  
In partnership with Zazzle and the CMU MHCI program, I helped design “Maker Kits” – a modular, collaborative design tool that enabled users at any skill level to create high-quality customizable products, reducing barriers to entry and driving engagement.

## Context & Challenge  
- Zazzle is a marketplace for customized products (clothing, accessories, decor) built around user creativity. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  
- The project stemmed from an MHCI capstone: Zazzle sought to shift from product-first to content-first workflows (users begin with a design concept, then pick product). :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  
- Key challenge: Make “creative design” accessible to non-designers while maintaining polish and flexibility.

## Role & Scope  
- Role: Student team lead (CMU MHCI) working with Zazzle product teams (2019)  
- Scope: Research, conceptual design, prototyping collaboration flows, working with real-world clients.

## Approach & Key Decisions  
- Developed Maker Kits: pre-designed templates + adjustable modules that users can mix, match and share.  
- Shifted interaction paradigm: let users define “what I want to say” (content first) instead of starting with “what product I want to customize”. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}  
- Designed collaboration layers: multi-user editing, chat + design feedback, versioning safeguards.  
- Focused on usability: onboarding flow, contextual hints, smart defaults to make output guarantee “looks good”.

## Outcomes & Impact  
- Zazzle adopted features from the capstone into its “Zazzle Create” and “Zazzle Collaboration” products. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}  
- [Fill in other metrics: user adoption %, reduction in drop-off, redesign speed improvements, anything you measured.]

## Notable Artifacts  
- Maker Kit template library  
- Collaboration interface prototype  
- Design system updates to support modular assets  

## Lessons & What’s Next  
- Empowering users through modular design reduces cognitive load and increases confidence.  
- Next step: integrate live co-editing with real-time preview and AI-assisted suggestions for compositions.
