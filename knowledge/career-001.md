### Career Summary
My career has centered around startups and complex problem spaces, moving from health tech to insure-tech, with repeated roles where I’m the connective tissue bringing clarity and coherence across teams and product surfaces.

## IDEO CoLab Fellowship
One of 25 fellows selected from ~2,500 applicants.  
The program consisted of rapid 1–2 week design sprints with industry and NGO partners, focused on:
- Wicked social problems  
- Emerging technology  
- Systems and service design  

I worked alongside exceptional designers and later returned as a mentor for incoming fellows.

## PicnicHealth (2020–2023)
**Senior Product Designer → Lead, Patient Experience & Growth**  
Joined as the third designer shortly after the Series A.

### Mission Context
PicnicHealth serves people living with rare and chronic illnesses, helping them unify their fragmented medical records and opt into clinical research cohorts. These patients often had dozens of providers across disconnected systems; our front-end experience was their window into clarity.

### Signature Achievement — PRO Survey Platform
I led the zero-to-one design and launch of the Patient-Reported Outcomes (PRO) survey platform — a clinically validated research tool that became the company’s #2 revenue driver.

**Impact:**
- > $10M ARR in year one  
- Scaled rapidly in subsequent years  
- Increased PRO completion from ~19% to ~80%  
- Became a foundational pillar of PicnicHealth’s research offering  

### Role Arc
- Led the Patient Experience & Growth team  
- Owned mobile and web design for all consumer surfaces  
- Worked deeply in regulated and clinically sensitive environments  
- Left in 2023 due to a company layoff impacting my team

## Jerry (2023–Present)
**Senior/Lead Product Designer**  
Series D, ~200 employees

Joined essentially as a backfill for a departing Head of Design and became the sole product designer for most of my time.

### Scope
Owned nearly every surface of Jerry’s mass-market consumer product:
- Web flows  
- Native mobile app  
- Growth and acquisition  
- Engagement & retention systems  
- Garage product  
- Insurance flows  
- Vehicle management tools  

### Why This Role Matters in My Arc
Jerry is where I:
- Operated with extreme breadth  
- Served as de-facto design leadership  
- Supported dozens of PMs simultaneously  
- Worked at true mass-market scale (hundreds of thousands to millions of users)  
- Developed deep experience in mobile app design  

This period sharpened my ability to bring cohesion, clarity, and momentum across a sprawling product ecosystem.
