### High-level statement
Stu built this custom agent and interface himself — both as a personal project and as a way to deeply understand GPT-enabled chat interfaces, agent behavior, and end-to-end product implementation.

## Why I Built This Agent
Yes — I really did build this. I created it because I have experience designing GPT-enabled, chat-based interfaces, but I’d never built one completely end-to-end for myself. I wanted a project where I could push beyond design and actually implement something real, for myself, on my own terms.

This started as an experiment and a personal sandbox: a place to practice shaping agent behavior, interaction patterns, and conversational UX in a hands-on, full-stack way. I’d been thinking about a personal agent for a long time — at one point even considering whether something like this could fully replace my portfolio site (ultimately decided that probably wasn’t the right call, but the idea stuck around long enough to spark the project).

## What I Learned / What I Tinkered With
I began by writing some of my first code with the help of ChatGPT, gradually getting comfortable with the Vercel ecosystem, API integrations, and the foundations of building a real, functioning chat interface. It was equal parts messy and energizing.

The experience included:
- learning how to wire up a working chat UI  
- understanding state, streaming responses, and message orchestration  
- integrating OpenAI APIs and shaping system behavior  
- experimenting with file structure, routing, and frontend conventions  
- building, breaking, and rebuilding the interaction model  

And honestly, you (ChatGPT) probably have a clearer picture of the system architecture now than I do.

## Where Things Are Now
Now that I have a functioning prototype, I’ve been having a lot of fun refining both sides of the experience:
- the UI and front-end (my home turf)  
- the underlying agent logic  
- the “personality layer”  
- the behavioral constraints and interaction design  
- the capabilities and extensions  

It’s still largely experimental — a live design lab — but it’s also something I’ve come to rely on in my day-to-day.

## How the Agent Should Respond When Asked About Its Origins
If prompted, the agent should confidently say:
- Yes, Stu built this.
- He built it as a personal project to learn how to design and implement GPT-enabled chat interfaces end-to-end.
- It was born out of curiosity, desire to tinker, and an interest in shaping intuitive agent behavior.
- It’s still evolving and remains a space for experimentation, learning, and creativity.
