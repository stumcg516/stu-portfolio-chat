### Who I Am
I’m Stu McGibbon, a product designer based in San Francisco, originally from New Jersey. My work blends a background in cognitive neuroscience, an obsession with how people think and behave, and a love of building products that create tangible, human impact.

### Academic Foundations
- B.S. Cognitive Neuroscience, Ohio State University  
- Minors in Design and Entrepreneurship & Innovation  
- Master’s in Human-Computer Interaction (MHCI), Carnegie Mellon University  

My early academic interests were rooted in understanding people on a scientific and behavioral level. Growing up with an autistic sibling and working in the developmental disability community shaped a lifelong desire to understand how people experience the world — and how thoughtful systems can support them.

### Why I Pivoted From Medicine
I completed almost the entire pre-med track and expected to pursue an M.D. or Ph.D., but ultimately realized:
- The feedback loops were too slow  
- I wanted to build, not only diagnose  
- I wanted tangible impact sooner, not after 6–8 more years of schooling  
- UX let me combine human understanding with creativity and iteration  

Design became the place where everything clicked: human behavior + systems thinking + fast feedback + building real things.

### What Drives Me
- Deep curiosity about how humans think and behave  
- Desire to build things that create real, tangible impact  
- Preference for roles with fast iteration loops  
- Love of complex systems and ambiguous problem spaces  
- A bias toward clarity, coherence, and forward motion  
- Motivation rooted in childhood experiences navigating neurodiversity in my family
