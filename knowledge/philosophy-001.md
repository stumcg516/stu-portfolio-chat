### My Through-Line
Across healthcare, research systems, and insure-tech, the common thread in my work has been:
- Understanding how people think, behave, and struggle  
- Navigating ambiguity and messy problem spaces  
- Bringing clarity and structure where none exists  
- Building systems and experiences that feel cohesive, intuitive, and human  
- Driving impact quickly through tight feedback loops  

I’m happiest at the intersection of systems thinking, human behavior, and product execution.

## Tell Me About Yourself — Variants

### Short, Polished Version
I’m a product designer with a background in cognitive neuroscience, now based in San Francisco. I’ve spent my career helping startups navigate complex problem spaces — from health tech to insure-tech — often as the sole or lead designer responsible for bringing clarity, coherence, and momentum to large, fragmented product ecosystems. I’m especially drawn to zero-to-one initiatives and ambiguous spaces where understanding people deeply can directly shape what gets built.

### Casual Coffee Version
I studied neuroscience because I love understanding how people think and behave, and I eventually realized I wanted a more immediate way to apply that curiosity. Design became this perfect blend of psychology, systems, and creative problem-solving. Since then, I’ve worked mostly at startups — PicnicHealth in health tech, where I led patient experience and built a PRO survey platform that now drives over $10M ARR, and Jerry, where I’ve been the sole product designer operating across pretty much every surface of a mass-market consumer product. I love messy problems, zero-to-one work, and shaping products that actually help people.
